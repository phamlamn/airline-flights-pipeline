# Design Specification - US Flight Delays Pipeline

<aside>
## **Airlines would like to analyze delay patterns.**

### The goal of this pipeline is to answer the following questions:

1. How does the overall flight volume vary by month? By day of week?
2. What percentage of flights experienced a departure delay in 2015? Among those flights, what was the average delay time, in minutes?
3. How does the % of delayed flights vary throughout the year? What about for flights leaving from Boston (BOS) specifically?
4. Which airlines seem to be most and least reliable, in terms of on-time departure?
5. How many flights were cancelled in 2015?
6. What % of cancellations were due to weather? What % were due to the Airline/Carrier?

# Business Metrics

| Metric Name | Question | Definition | Is Guardrail Metric? |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| flight_volume | 1. How does the overall flight volume vary by month? By day of week? | COUNT(flights) / time_period | Yes, if significant drop in flight volume, this could indicate a major issue |
| delay_rate | 2. What percentage of flights experienced a departure delay in 2015? | COUNT(delayed_flights) / COUNT(flights) | Yes, sudden changes to % of flights delayed could indicate issues |
| avg_delay_time | 2. Among those flights, what was the average delay time? | AVG(departure_delay) | Yes, sudden changes to average delay time could indicate issues |
| delay_rate_over_time | 3.How does the % of delayed flights vary throughout the year? | COUNT(delayed_flights) / COUNT(flights) GROUP BY month | Yes, drastic differences in seasonality, month-over-month, year-over-year patterns could indicate issues |
| delay_rate_over_time_by_airport | 3. What about for flights leaving from Boston (BOS) specifically? | COUNT(delayed_flights) / COUNT(flights) GROUP BY month, airport | Yes, could indicate issue with airport |
| airline_on_time_rate | 4. Which airlines seem to be most and least reliable, in terms of on-time departure? | COUNT(CASE WHEN departure_delay â‰¤ 0 THEN 1 END) GROUP BY airline | Yes, changes to reliablility of airlines could indicate issues |
| cancelled_flights | 5. How many flights were cancelled in 2015? | COUNT(cancelled_flights) | Yes, number of canceled flights could indicate issues |
| cancel_reason_breakdown | 6. What % of cancellations were due to weather or due to the Airline/Carrier? | COUNT(cancelled_flights) GROUP BY cancellation_reason | Yes, reasons for cancellations could indicate issues |

# Table Schemas

## Fact_flights

This table is a list of all flight records as an accumulating snapshot fact table. It contains comprehensive flight data including departure/arrival times, delays, cancellations, and reasons for delays.

The unique identifier for this table is a composite key of **date**, **airline**, **flight_number**, and **departure_time** since no two flights from the same airline can have the same flight_number at the same time

## Agg_fact_flights

This aggregation table contains flight metrics aggregated at different levels (yearly, monthly, day_of_week) and grouped by different dimensions (airline, airport, etc.) to support various analytical queries about delays, cancellations, and flight volumes.

Includes metrics such as:

- Total flight counts and volume patterns
- Delay statistics including delay rates and average delay durations
- Cancellation metrics broken down by reason codes (A=Carrier, B=Weather, C=National Air System, D=Security)

Contains multiple aggregation levels to enable flexible analysis:

- Time-based levels: Yearly, monthly, and day-of-week trends
- Dimensional levels: Overall metrics, airline specific, and origin airport specific analysis

The unique identifier for this table is a composite key consisting of all dimensions and agg_levels (ie. **year, month, day_of_week, airline, origin_airport, time_agg_level, agg_level**). This combination uniquely identifies each aggregation record and reflects the multi-level nature of the aggregations stored in this table.

Note, adding new aggregation metrics can be accomplished by simply adding additional columns for the dimensions and appending new records for the aggregations. As existing records are not aggregated on the new dimensions, we can set this column to null for existing records. This is a non-breaking change.
